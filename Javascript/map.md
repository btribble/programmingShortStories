Once upon a time...

What would an investiture for programming magic look like? 
It would need to be something that was limited, could be used up, and replinished....

The magics... how do they work...
Apply methods to specific things -- and some things could be protected(like frozen objects). 

So for example, you might apply a filter function to mailbox, or a trash/recycling bin. 



Make the magic system consistent with different levels of mastery.
